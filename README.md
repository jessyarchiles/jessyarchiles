## Skills

### Javascript

My "native" programming language, I've worked with it for over 6 years. I've used it in the front-end with *Vue.js* and *Angular*, in the back-end for APIs with *Node*, *Express* and *Nest.js* and for testing automation using *Jest* or *Cypress*.

### Continuous Integration

I love to be able to have a framework for building safe code and that everyone can enjoy. Automating the process to the maximum, we can have time to focus on the important topics and still have time to improve !

### Interface Design & User Experience

Making the interface usable, and to a greater extent enjoyable to the user, is a really fun and satisfying process for me as I strive to shape things elegently (or at least I try).

### Technical Presentations

I enjoy writing about technical subjects and I feel I can do a pretty good job about it! My motivation is to explain things in simple and practical terms and thus making things easier for everyone.
